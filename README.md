### Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

> My name is Noah do RÃ©go, and I'm currently a student at the **University of Ottawa**. I have experience with several languages, lately I've been using *HTML/CSS, Python, React and C#*.

### Some of my interests:
- **Front-end Web Development:** I enjoy designing/creating different styles of websites by wireframing in Figma and learning more about effective UI/UX.
- **Game Development:** I've been using Unity for the past couple of years to make different games, one of which is PLANT.
- **App Development:** I just started using React to create web apps and look to learn more about the language.
